In this article, I tell about my journey of learning the English language. We will consider four main topics here, these are;

- Speaking
- Listening
- Writing
- Reading

### Speaking

In order to improve my English speaking practice, I take private lessons 2 days a week, half an hour a day. In our meeting, we talk about everyday topics and general interview questions. If you want to take a private lesson for speaking practice, you can contact me. Other suggestions for speaking practice.

- Expand your vocabulary
- Improve your pronunciation
- Learn the natural flow of English
- Build English speaking confidence
- Speech shadowing
- Self-talk
- Think in English
- Retell a story in English
- Participate in public speaking events
- Go to language cafes
- Using apps
- Chat with Siri

### Listening

I improve my English listening ability, by following English courses and training related to my department and I have made it a habit. Watching a tutorial in English helps us learn their pronunciation. In addition, if there are things that I do not understand, especially while listening, I look up their meanings and pronunciation using google translate.

### Writing

I love taking notes while learning something new and I keep my notes sometimes in English. In this way, I have improved my English both in writing and technically. I have been writing articles on my blog for one month. This both excites me and causes me to constantly keep myself alive for writing in English. Finally, I use the [Cambridge Grammar books](https://www.trendyol.com/cambridge-university-press/grammar-in-use-3-lu-set-p-36330649) series of educational books to improve my writing and reading skills. The book explains the subject on the left page and gives practice on the right.

### Reading

I use a [Chrome extension daily.dev](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dailydev-the-homepage-dev/jlmpjdjjbgclbocgajdjefcidcncaied) that displays popular and current articles, and I try to read at least one article a week. As a result, I both reinforce what I have learned and continue to learn new things. Apart from that, I read English books related to my field and I prefer to use English resources when I research something.
